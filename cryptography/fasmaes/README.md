# Description
An AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 implementation for FASM. Uses the x86 32-bit
instruction set and operates completely on the stack. No additional data
segments are necessary which makes it easy to integrate the AES functions in any
existing project. The implementation is not optimized for speed but for easy
maintainability.
