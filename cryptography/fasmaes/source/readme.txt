# DESCRIPTION                                                                 #
# An AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 implementation for FASM. Uses the the x86   #
# 32-bit or 32-bit instruction set and operates completely on the stack. No   #
# data segments are necessary which makes it easy to integrate the AES        #
# functions in any existing project. The implementation is not optimized      #
# for speed but for easy maintainability.                                     #
#                                                                             #
# Consists of two functions:                                                  #
#                                                                             #
# - encAES(size, source, destination, key)                                    #
# - decAES(size, source, destination, key)                                    #
#                                                                             #
# "Size" has to be an integer multiple of 16 (the AES block size). The        #
# function encAES() encrypts the data in the "source" buffer with the         #
# corresponding "key" and stores the result in "destination". The function    #
# decAES() decrypts the data in "source" and stores the result in the         #
# "destination" buffer. They key size (128, 192 and 256) can be set by        #
# a switch in the "aes.inc" file. Comes with two examples:                    #
#                                                                             #
# aesexample1.asm:      Simple exe which encrypts and decrypts a text         #
# aesexample2.asm:      Produces a dll which exports the encryption and       #
#                       decryption functions                                  #
# aesexampel2test.asm:  calls the generated dll                               #
#                                                                             #
# Examples use windows APIs but the implementation itself can be used on any  #
# x86 plattform.                                                              #
