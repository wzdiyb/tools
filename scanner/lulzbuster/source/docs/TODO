ChangeLog and TODO list for lulzbuster
======================================


===> 1.X.X

  [ ] new feature: build statistics during scan and print them at the end
  [ ] new feature: recursive scan + exclude given directories
  [ ] new feature: save and restore session after 'ctrl+c'
  [ ] new option: implement debug mode
  [ ] new option: implement verbose mode
  [ ] attack.c: attack(): collect hits table. if 200 was given with same size
      over X times -> claim false-positive
  [ ] attack.c: attack(): make smarter: for wildcard part: check also a few
      bytes of content before claiming false-positive.
  [ ] http.c: do_req(): handle errors in a pragmatic way: count for X errors and
      then offer something to do as next or give up
  [ ] make better LOG functions and define them clearly so we can use it
      everywhere at anytime and don't mix shit
  [ ] make fast if '-f' option was used. (handle 301 codes correctly). we
      probably would need to fetch location header and build/set new url :s
  [ ] grep for 'TODO' and fix/implement them
  [ ] really, clean up and refactor the code a bit where necessary


===> 1.1.0

  [x] update: set max line length (1024 bytes) to read from wordlists
